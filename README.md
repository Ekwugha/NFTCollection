# NFTCollection

This is a NFT Collection. NFT standing for non-fungible token.



What is a Non-Fungible Token? Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable eg Eth is fungible. With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. 
Every single token has unique characteristics and values. They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable eg Unique Art




What is ERC-721? ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; 
it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs. 


So in this repo, a NFT Collection is ceated using ERC-721 standard.
